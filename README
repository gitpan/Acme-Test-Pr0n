NAME
       Acme::Test::Pr0n - Perl extension for wasting your time

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More tests => 3;
         use Acme::Test::Pr0n;

         my $filename = '/any/old/text/file.txt';

         my $pr0n_test = Acme::Test::Pr0n->new({
             'filename' => $filename,
         });

         ok($pr0n_test->pr0n() > 5,
                    'The string pr0n is hidden in the file more than 5 times');

         ok($pr0n_test->XXX() > 4,
                    'The string XXX is hidden in the file more than 4 times');

         ok($pr0n_test->XXX('i') > 4,
                    'The string XXX is hidden in the file more than 4 times
                     without beinge case sensative');


DESCRIPTION
       This test object has bveen inspired by Schwern and
       advanced testing, a conversation on IRC and a reference to
       Schwern and pr0n.  Having written it I realise it's not
       very pr0n specific but I'm sure it will be abused prop-
       perly.

       Any thing can be tested for, just make up the method name
       and pass in a 'i' if you want it case insensative.

EXPORTED

       None by default.
